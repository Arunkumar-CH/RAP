# ABAP RESTful Application Programming Model

### Overview
This course will provide information about how to build SAP HANA-optimized SAP Fiori apps with the ABAP RESTful Programming Model - based on core data services (CDS), behavior definition and implementation languages for the transactional enablement of business objects, and business services for the OData-based data exposure. 

The ABAP RESTful Programming Model is the evolutionary successor of the ABAP Programming Model for SAP Fiori.

It's an open e-learning course that you can take at your own pace. It is from the [SAP Development Learning](https://jam4.sapjam.com/groups/K8n1CrLcvN9kUh0MVxL6H8/overview_page/40usfspAJquXLBgmgi6PWq).

### Learning objectives 

Upon Completion of this course, you will be able to:
* Define and consume views using Core Data Services (CDS views) with annotations
* Define CDS behaviors and implementations to develop unmanaged and managed transactional applications
* Create OData services by defining and binding a service based on a CDS view

### Topics/Agenda
* CDS view as a new data model layer using a data source that is already provided.
* CDS annotations to manifest semantics for the data model.
* Unmanaged and Managed transactional applications using CDS Behavior and implementation
* Service Definition and Service Binding to consume from user interface
* UI annotations as a UI technology independent semantic description of the user interface layout.

### Prerequisites 
* Client installation of ABAP Development Tools (ADT), We recommend that you use the latest available ADT client, which can be downloaded from the update site http://adt.wdf.sap.corp:8080/.
* Any ABAP system starting from release S/4HANA 1808 or AS ABAP 7.75.
* To create the demo scenario, the database tables of the ABAP Flight Reference Scenario that represents the legacy business logic must be available in your ABAP Environment. 
* Basic knowledge of ABAP Core Data Services (CDS) and ABAP Objects.
